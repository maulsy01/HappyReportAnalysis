<p>The main focus of our data analysis is answering “what does the world happines look like?”. Is it increasing, decreasing or remaining the same? What regions of the world are happier? Which country is the happiest? What catgories are highest for the happiest countries and/or regions? In general, we want to find the trends of happiness and those specific categories for each country and region over the past three years. Also, with this knowledge in mind, it may help us describe our future or explain how events in the world may affect happiness score.</p>

<p>The following data is from the Happiness Report data from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2015.csv">2015</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2016.csv">2016</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2017.csv">2017</a>. Each of the datasets contain the country, their happiness score, and their happiness rate. Also, it shows the scores of each of the different categories that make up the happiness score. These scores for the categories added together make up the happiness score. These categories are: Distopia Residual, Economy (GDP per Capita), Family, Freedom, Generosity, Health (Life Expectancy), and Trust (Government Corruption).</p>

<h2>Cleaning the Data<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning-the-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We obtained the Happiness Report data from 2015, 2016, and 2017. We wanted to combine the three datasets into one dataset. The columns in the 2017 data had to be changed in order to match the other two datasets. We also added a year column to each dataset so when we combined them we could be able to tell which year the data is from. We also needed to add a region column to the 2017 data using the other datasets because there was not a region column.</p>
<p>Here is the code we used to create the region column:</p>

<h2>General Information<a class="headerlink" href="#general-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We first wanted to know more general information about the data, such as what countries are the happiest and how have the countries changed over the years.</p>
<p>We started by generally looking at the difference in happiness score over the time period of 2015-2017.</p>
<p>The following plot shows the average happiness score in the world over 3 years. As one can see from the graph, the happiness score from 2015 to 2016 increases by around 0.010. However, from 2016-2017, the happiness score drops. Although the drop seems very signigicant on the line plot, it only drops around a happiness score of 0.030. Also, this is solely a drop of around 0.020 from 2015 to 2017. It is quite interesting, however, to note that happiness over the world is not just a continous increase.</p>
<div class="line-block">

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Next, we wanted to see the top countries for happiness over three years, and whether or not they vary significantly.</p>
<p>The following bar plot shows the number of country appearances in the top 5 happiest countries over 2015-2017. The plot shows that only 6 countries in the world reach the top 5 happiest over three years. Therefore, the happiest countries remain relatively stable over the years. Four out of the six countries have been in the top 5 happiest countries every year. The only exceptions include Canada, with only 1 appearance, and Finland, with two appearances.</p>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>The following plot shows the average happiness score in each region in the year 2017. It shows that Western Europe, North America, and Australia and New Zealand have the highest average happiness scores, while Sub-Saharan Africa and Sourhtern Asia have the lowest average happiness scores.</p>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>We, then, wondered whether the percent change of happiness score over the three years would have any specific trend for regions, countries, or with one of the 6 categories. So, we created a new data frame with percent change as a column.</p>
<p>The code to create the dataframe with percent change is shown below:</p>

<p>With the new percent change dataframe, we wanted to see which countries had the top growth in happiness score, and which countries had the least growth in happiness score.</p>
<p>The following bar plot shows the highest and lowest growth of percent change over 2015-2017 for each country. The plot shows that Togo had the highest growth in happiness over the three years, followed by Senegal, Syria, Latvia, etc. The country with least growth is Central African Republic, followed by Venezuela, Liberia, Lesotho, etc. One intriguing find was that there were a couple countries from Africa on both the top growth and least growth. Also, a couple Latin America countries are in the least growth trend.</p>

<p>From the plot above’s interesting finds of countries from specific regions, we decided to look further into that trend. So, we decided to plot the average percent score for each region in the world.</p>
<p>The following bar plot shows each region’s percent change over 2015-2017. Australia and New Zealand, Eastern Asia, and Western Europe all seem to have increased slightly, but by not that much. Latin America and Caribbean drastically decreased compared to the other countries, while Southeastern Asia had the largest growth in happiness over the 3 years.</p>

<p>It only seemed logical to further look at percent change for each region with a scatter plot.</p>
<p>The following scatter plot has each point representing each country, labels it depending on the region, and plots it based on its average percent change of happiness score over 3 years. Western Europe seems to be relatively stable when it comes to percent change. However, Sub-Saharan Africa seems to change drastically with some countries with high percent changes, and some countries with the complete opposite change.</p>

<h2>Categorical Exploration<a class="headerlink" href="#categorical-exploration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our next question in our analysis was which areas of happiness are most important in forming the happiness score.</p>
<p>The following line plot shows the average mean score over every year for every category. Dystopia Residual went up in 2016 but dropped down in 2017, whereas family went down in 2016 but back up in 2017.

<p>The following line plot takes the average score for each happiness rank over the past three years and plots them starting with rank 1 on the left.
