# Sam's Journal
### 11/6/2018
Today is the day we started on the project. We spend most of the time attempting to find a good data set. As we searched, numerous data sets did not seem to be big enough for what we wanted to do. There were so many interesting data sets, but some just would not work for our project. Some of the data sets we came across was a college food data, an Olympic data set, and a Republican versus Democrat data set.

I ended up finding a large, and very interesting data set that would work for the project. I presented it to Sydney, and she agreed it would work. That data set was the driving accident data set. The data sets gave us two different years that we can use to combine the data. Much of the data was numeric, but also a good amount of categorical data. There were around 60 rows for each year and many rows. This is where we ended the day for our project. 

### 11/8/2018
During class today, Sydney and I found which specific data sets from the traffic accidents to join together. We decided to use the accidents general data sets for both 2015 and 2016 to join together. Also, we pre-discussed and wrote down ideas of trends and specific plots we can use for the data. We discussed these types of trends before we specifically chose the accident 2015 and 2016 data sets in order to choose which data set would be the best. Then, we continued to discuss and write down these trends. 

However, after long discussing the trends and plots, we could not easily download the data sets. We tried to find the different ways to download it using Kaggle and downloading other methods. In the end, we could not find out how to download, so we tried searching for similar data sets. However, no data sets could match well enough, so we decided to start searching for other data sets. But, the class period ended, so we left our separate ways. 
  
### 11/9/2018
After searching on our own, we finally met up and realized we didn’t have a single data set to use. However, we both searched some more together and we came across the World Happiness Report, which had data over 2015-2017. We decided to look through the data and came up with ideas of what types of plots we could use. We did this to make sure that this data set would be usable. Also, we decided we can just merge all three years into one larger data set. 

Once we both officially agreed on the specific data set, we started to write down the different plot ideas we talked about. Also, we talked about certain correlations and interesting data we could look up. This is where our meeting ended, but we both felt comfortable at where we were at for the project, so we just planned on working next class period.

### 11/13/2018
During class, I decided I would create the website, while Sydney cleaned and merged the three years of data together. For the website, I followed the rules on the website. I asked a couple of questions, because I was unsure where to set up the release code, but finally got it in the right file. However, I was trying to put the code in Visual Studio Code, which cause random spaces. 

Finally, I got it fixed with Professor Lee’s help, because I needed to use the vi editor instead. I finally got the website pushed and working. Then, Sydney asked a couple of questions while she finished up cleaning the data. The class then ended, so we decided we shall meet up tomorrow to continue working. 
  
### 11/14/2018
We met up in the afternoon and Sydney was struggling to delete specific values dring her cleaning. I found online the .at function for Pandas data frames instead of using loc, which fixed the issue. Afterwards, I showed Sydney how to upload to the website and pull information from the terminal, when she makes changes. Then, we discussed on what we need to do for the project now. We ended up writing down every visualization we could think of and what interesting trends we could use for each visualization. 

Once all of it was written down, we split up the ideas 50/50 between Sydney and I of what we can work on over the weekend. This is where our meeting ended, but gave us both the ability to work separately on coming up with graphs over the weekend. 

### 11/15/2018
For today’s class, I started to put Sydney and I’s journals on our repository in a separate folder. Each of the files will be in Markdown, as it is super easy to do. I showed Sydney where her markdown journal was, so she could start posting her journal entries there. I have written notes upon each of my journals, but haven’t written them out in paragraphs. This will need to be done later.

Also, today marked the day where I started to actually dive into the graphical representations for the project. I created a couple simple graphs, then moved further into a more challenging graph. The graph I wanted to do was a bar graph that had a different bar for each category and separated by each region. It took me a very long time to get, but finally I got it (with the help of Stack Exchange)! Class ended right at this moment, but both Sydney and I were determined to get our separate work on the graph’s done over the weekend.

### 11/17/2018
Over the weekend, I continued to work further on the graphs. Most of my graphical representations were pretty simple at first, like showing the top happies country over 3 years or the family versus trust correlation graph. I wanted to do something different and more intriguing, however. This is when I sparked the idea of creating a percent change over the three years data frame. 

I started to make the data frame, but had to figure out how to separate the years, then do math on each value in the column. Once all that was done, I need to make that a new column. I started by making two different series for 2015 and 2017. I took those two series and merged them together on country. Lastly, I created a new column to be equal to Happiness Score 2017 minus Happiness Score 2015 all divided by Happiness Score 2015 times 100. I then took a break from working on the assignment.
	
### 11/17/2018 (continued)
A couple hours later, I went back to actually create graphs for percent change data frame. The first graph I created was a bar graph of the top percent growth. Then, I thought it would be interesting to find both the top percent growth and the least percent growth on a bar graph. Next, I used the mean percent growth for each region to see if there was some common trends by regions.

Lastly, I wanted to take upon the project of creating a scatter plot somehow for percent change. I decided to do something similar to my multi-bar chart but as a scatter plot. So, I wanted to make the percent change for each country, but specific regions will have different colored points. I found that some regions percent change remains closely related, where some are very drastic. I then decided I wanted to create more line graphs, because Sydney and I had none. So, I completed my creation of graphical representations with two line graphs.
  
### 11/18/2018
During class today, Sydney and I decided we need a game plan. We need to discuss each other’s graphs and what steps we need to take next. After showing each other our graphs, we listed what we need to accomplish. We need to order our graphs to be in a presentable order and merge our graphs and code together. We also need to add lots of comments on our code and graph. We also talked about adding more graphs.

Furthermore, we need to add journal entries in project repository. Lastly, we talked about making the presentations. We listed the criteria we are being graded upon, focused on how we want to sell our data analysis, and wrote those ideas down. This is where we departed for break, but both said we will work over break for a bit, and come back and meet many times next week. 

### 11/24/2018
Over break, I started to write out ideas for graphs that I could come up with. I mainly focused on thinking of interactive graph ideas. For the rest of the time I just worked on typing out my journals. I did not have as much time as I thought, so I was unable to complete my journals. This is where the day for data science ended for me.

### 11/25/2018
Today, I worked on finishing writing out all of my journals and catching up on work. I relooked at my ideas for my graphs. I came up with some new ideas, while throwing away old ones. I continued to research on the interactive graphs, and what would be potential uses for my data. Also, Sydney and I talked about the project and what we need to do in the upcoming days. I finally uploaded my journal but will work more on the project tomorrow!

### 11/26/2018
I worked on creating the multi bar graphs that shows the mean of each category for every year. This did not take me as long, as I created a similar plot previously. Then, I decided to work upon creating interactive graphs. I used the example from class to help figure out what I can do. From there, I created two different interactive graphs from previous plots I created. It took me some time to convert it, but I finally got it. From here I finished writing my comments on my code for my plots and commenting on what my plots show. 

### 11/27/2018
During class, Sydney and I planned out the order of our narrative and visualizations. After some work and some fails, we finally got the theme and website format all planned out. We created an image folder on github to put all of our visualizations so we can easily link to them for our website. We now have to start to add our information into the website! This is where our day ended.
