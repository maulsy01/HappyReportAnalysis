We started searching for a data set for our project. One of the initial thoughts we had was a data set relating to Game of Thrones data. 
There is a data set relating to the battles and deaths in Game of Thrones. Some other data sets I found that I thought might work were
college student meals, McDonald's menu calories, board game information, and Olympics data.

We decided on a data set that Sam found: US Traffic Fatality Records. Some possible questions we would like to answer with this data set 
are: What is correlated to crashes? Are certain days of the week, months, or years that are more common for accidents?

There are many different data sets available, and we looked through them all to decide which ones we wanted to use. We decided to use the
Accident data sets from 2015 and 2016 because they encompass the most interesting information. We will combine these two data sets into
one. 

After deciding this, we attempted to download the data. Kaggle will not allow download the data directly. It said we had to query the data
on Kaggle.

We were unable to figure out how to access the traffic fatality data. After some more searching for data sets, we decided to use the data
set World Happiness Report for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Some questions we would like to consider are: What are the happiest countries/regions? What factors have led
to this happiness? How has happiness changed over time? We then brainstormed ideas for what visualizations we wanted to do with our data.

While Sam worked on setting up the github website, I worked on cleaning and combining the data sets for the three years of data into one.
I had to change the column names in the 2017 data set so they are the same as the other two data sets. After I changed the column names, I 
added a column to each data set with the year so we will know the year after the data sets are combined. I then wanted to create a column in the 2017 data for region using the region information in the other data sets.
